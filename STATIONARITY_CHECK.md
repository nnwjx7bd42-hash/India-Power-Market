## Tests Used

- **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller):** H0 = unit root (non-stationary). **p < 0.05** ⇒ reject H0 ⇒ series is **stationary** (no unit root).
- **KPSS:** H0 = series is stationary. **p > 0.05** ⇒ fail to reject ⇒ **stationary**. KPSS is strict on long series and often rejects (trend/level issues).

## Results (key series)

| Series   | ADF p-value | ADF result   | KPSS p-value | KPSS result   | Conclusion        |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| P(T)     | 0.000000    | Stationary   | 0.01         | Non-stationary | Mixed             |
| L(T-1)   | 0.000000    | Stationary   | 0.01         | Non-stationary | Mixed             |
| Demand   | 0.000003    | Stationary   | 0.01         | Non-stationary | Mixed             |
| Thermal  | 0.000111    | Stationary   | 0.01         | Non-stationary | Mixed             |

- **ADF:** All four series **reject unit root** (p ≪ 0.05) ⇒ no evidence of a unit root; consistent with stationarity or trend-stationarity.
- **KPSS:** All four **reject stationarity** (p = 0.01, at table limit). For long hourly series with level/trend, KPSS often rejects; the test is conservative here.

**Practical takeaway:** ADF suggests the series do not have a unit root. KPSS suggests level/trend non-stationarity (e.g. growing demand/load over years). For **hourly price forecasting with lags and exogenous variables**, the pipeline does not assume strict stationarity; using levels + lags + calendar/weather is standard and the model can capture persistence and seasonality.

## Autocorrelation: P(T)

First 24 lags (hourly):

- **Lag 1:** ~0.89 (very strong)
- **Lag 24:** ~0.89 (same-hour-yesterday)
- **Lags 2–23:** Decay then rise toward lag 24 (daily cycle)

So **P(T)** has strong persistence and a clear **24h seasonal** component, which supports using **P(T-1), P(T-24), P(T-48), P_T-168** (and similar) as in the current feature set.
